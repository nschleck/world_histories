Features
   * Tags
   * These are gonna be highly subjective and may require careful consideration
   * Type
   * Astrological, Geological, Life, Invention/Discovery, War, People, Arts
   * Era
   *  Pre Earth, Early Earth, Early Humans, Antiquity(?), … (?)
   * Culture
   *    * Region
   * Tag selector - exclusive tags, or exclude specific tags
   * Color entries by a single tag type? Type/Era/etc.
   * Date Range - mode for true spacing display, or equally spaced display
   * Entries can be single points (i.e. 543 BC) or spans (700-900 AD)
   * Links to wikipedia and/or other source?
   * TBD: how to differentiate between date estimates (e.g. geological events) and time spans?


Structure
   * Seems to really lend itself to Event as an object class, with a container class?
   * Get guidance on container classes
