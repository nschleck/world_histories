This project aims to create a "historical events visualizer" app:

I often struggle to remember when historical events happened, or if one event came before another. 
So, I wanted to create an interactive app that allows the user to select a timespan and category tags, and get a visual understanding of events in that time period.

The current approach is to utilize Python's pygame module.
